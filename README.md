Live Demo:https://howzaycalderon.github.io/Project_1/

This is a front-end game application developed as my first project while studying at General Assembly.

This is a Trivia Game that tests a person's knowledge of a varierty of Anime shows. As users work through the game and answer questions correctly they will receive points and eventually win. If more than 3 questions are answered incorrectly the player loses.
